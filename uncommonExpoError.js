This error typically occurs when you're using Expo's managed workflow and attempt to import modules or use features that aren't supported in the Expo Go app or the managed workflow environment.  It can manifest in several ways, including but not limited to:  `Invariant Violation: requireNativeComponent: "RCTCamera" was not found`. This often points towards native modules (like camera access) that are unavailable in the managed workflow unless you eject or use an alternative approach. Another symptom could be cryptic errors during runtime, especially when interacting with third-party libraries that have native dependencies. The error messages themselves might not directly pinpoint the incompatibility, leading to debugging challenges.

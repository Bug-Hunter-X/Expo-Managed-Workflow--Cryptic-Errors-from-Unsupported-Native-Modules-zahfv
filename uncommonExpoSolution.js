The solution depends on the specific native module causing the issue. If possible, use Expo's built-in APIs instead of importing a native module directly. For example, instead of using a custom native camera module, use `expo-camera`.  If a suitable Expo API doesn't exist, consider one of the following:

1. **Eject from Expo's managed workflow:** This gives you complete control but requires more native development knowledge. This is often the most involved approach and increases the project's complexity and maintenance burden.
2. **Use an alternative library:** Search for compatible libraries without native dependencies. Many libraries offer pure JavaScript alternatives that work well in Expo's environment.
3. **Implement a custom solution:** Use a JavaScript-based solution instead of a native module.  For example, use a different method to achieve the desired functionality without relying on native code.  This may involve more work up-front, but can prevent many issues associated with native module integration.

Example code demonstrating the problem and its solution might involve comparing the usage of a camera library that has a native dependency versus using Expo's built-in camera API.
